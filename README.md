Vectorblox MXP

The VectorBlox MXP Matrix Processor is an FPGA-based soft processor capable of
highly parallel execution. Programmed entirely in C/C++, the MXP is capable of
executing data-parallel software algorithms at hardware-like speeds. MXP's
parametrized design lets the user specify the amount of parallelism required,
 ranging from 1 to 128 or more parallel ALUs. Key features of the MXP include
a parallel-access scratchpad memory to hold vector data and a high-throughput
 DMA engine.

VectorBlox Computing licenses the MXP processor as a synthesizable IP core
for use in FPGA designs.

This release consists of:

* Hardware IP packaged for Altera's Quartus and Xilinx's ISE and Vivado toolchains
 (License Required)

* x86 based functional Simulator  (License Required)
